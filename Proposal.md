### Short Bio
Space has always fascinated me. From an early age I used to read encyclopedias and books on Big Bang and Black holes and wonder what was out there. I am always curious about how everything came into existence and what is the purpose of we being here.
I choose Open Astronomy and SunPy all out of curiosity and my love for Astronomy.
And I would love to be a tiny part of SunPy.
