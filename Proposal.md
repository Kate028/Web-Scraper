### Short Bio
Space has always fascinated me. From an early age I used to read encyclopedias and books on Big Bang and Black holes and wonder what was out there. I am always curious about how everything came into existence and what is the purpose of we being here.
I choose Open Astronomy and SunPy all out of curiosity and my love for Astronomy.
And I would love to be a tiny part of SunPy.

### Section 3: Applicant and the Project Idea

What excites me about this project? Why did I choose it?
The name of the project itself is very absorbing. After looking into it I feel wow how we can crawl the ever changing web to get something useful out of it.

Why me?
I am a very curious person and a fast learner.
I accept when I don’t know something and try to grasp it asap. I never leave things undone. When I put my hand to something despite the difficulties, I found my way out.
Also, these days I have been working on some Web-Scraping projects and learning required skill sets that make me confident enough to do this project.

#### The Project Plan

Synopsis
SunPy provides a way for users to access data and its many in
The functionality within sunpy.util.scraper is really useful and is used within Fido for data retriever clients. 
The goal of this project is to create a new scraper with a predefined API and class structure.
It is also particularly confusing to use with the regex keyword and hence makes it challenging to write new clients.

This project is to rewrite the scraper 
Scraper crashes with specific url pattern #4493



#### Deliverables

## Just a reminder to you Kate it's incomplete

Functions
API.
Documentation of the above code and necessary Gallery examples.


Timeline

Community bonding period (May 17 - June 7)

The community bonding period is of nearly 3 weeks. 
I will be exploring the scraper, required modules and the API design and try understanding the project. I will discuss with my mentors if having any doubts.
           I will increase my knowledge on protocol and how can we use
           web browsers for data extraction.
figure it out if we can use parse instead of python regex.
           Also, I will look into https://github.com/r1chardj0n3s/parse.

I’ll explore what all can be done to make 


Week 1 (June 7 - June 14)
SunPy provides a way for users to access data and its many internal clients.
Many of these simpler clients do URL Scraping
